# Example: use when the server already has Nginx on 80/443 and you want it to proxy to this app.
# Copy to docker-compose.override.yml and run: docker compose up -d postgres app
# (do not start nginx). Then configure your existing Nginx to proxy to http://127.0.0.1:3000

services:
  app:
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:3000:3000"
